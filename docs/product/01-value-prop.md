# Value Proposition — Larry

Larry is a **B2C product for individual professionals** who need trustworthy answers from their own documents.

Larry does not try to be creative.
Larry is designed to be **reliable**.

---

## One-Line Definition

**Larry answers questions based exclusively on your documents, always with sources — or clearly says it cannot find the answer.**

---

## The Problem

Professionals regularly receive long, complex documents:
- contracts
- reports
- technical PDFs
- spreadsheets with critical data

Reading everything manually is slow.
Relying on generic AI answers is risky.

In many cases, **a wrong answer can have serious consequences**:
- legal
- professional
- academic

The core problem is not speed.
The core problem is **trust**.

---

## The Solution

Larry allows users to:
- upload their own documents
- ask natural language questions
- receive answers **only if they are supported by the documents**
- see exactly **where each answer comes from**

If the information is not present, Larry explicitly says so.

---

## What Makes Larry Different

Larry is built around three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Source-backed answers**
   - Every answer is traceable to specific document fragments.
   - Sources are always visible.

2. **Strict mode by default**
   - Larry never invents or extrapolates.
   - "No answer found" is a valid and expected response.

3. **Document-only reasoning**
   - Larry uses only the user's uploaded documents.
   - No external knowledge is mixed in.

---

## Target User

Larry is designed primarily for:
- freelancers
- consultants
- lawyers
- researchers
- independent professionals

People who:
- work with critical documents
- need to trust what they read
- often need to justify or forward answers

---

## Primary Context of Use

> "I use Larry when someone sends me a long document and I need reliable answers without reading everything."

---

## Product Philosophy

Larry prioritizes:
- correctness over creativity
- traceability over fluency
- explicit uncertainty over confident guessing
- simplicity over configurability

Larry is not a general-purpose chatbot.
Larry is a **document reasoning tool**.

---

## Interaction Model

- Web-only interaction
- No email workflows
- Real-time feedback via the UI
- Persistent history for accountability

---

## Success Criteria

Larry is successful when:
- users trust its answers enough to act on them
- "no answer" is perceived as a strength, not a failure
- users feel safer making decisions based on their documents

---

This value proposition defines the **foundation of the product**.
Any feature that undermines trust, traceability, or strictness is out of scope.
